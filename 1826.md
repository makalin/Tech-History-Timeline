## **1826 – The Year of Early Photography, Industrial Growth, and Scientific Curiosity**

### **January**

* **First Photograph Taken**: **Joseph Nicéphore Niépce** captures the **world’s earliest surviving photograph** from a window in France using a process called **heliography**, marking the **birth of photography**.
* **Steam Power Spreads Across Europe**: Steam engines continue expanding from Britain into continental Europe, powering **factories, mills, and mines**, accelerating the **Industrial Revolution**.

### **March**

* **Ohm’s Law Formulated**: German physicist **Georg Simon Ohm** formally publishes **Ohm’s Law**, establishing the mathematical relationship between **voltage, current, and resistance** — a fundamental principle of **electrical circuits**.
* **Naval Innovation in the U.S. and Britain**: Early tests of **steam-powered naval ships** are carried out, signaling a shift from sail to **mechanized naval engineering**.

### **May**

* **Deaths of Thomas Jefferson and John Adams (July 4 Anticipation)**: Although they die in **1826 July**, both **founding fathers** are ailing by spring, and the public begins reflecting on the **50th anniversary of the U.S. Declaration of Independence**.

### **July**

* **July 4: Thomas Jefferson and John Adams Die on Same Day**: On the **50th anniversary** of U.S. independence, **Jefferson and Adams** both die within hours of each other, an extraordinary historical coincidence that deeply impacts the American public.
* **American Railroad Expansion**: Railroad projects begin spreading from **Northeastern U.S. cities** like Baltimore and Boston, laying the groundwork for future transcontinental development.

### **August**

* **Beethoven's Late Works Continue Circulating**: Though **Ludwig van Beethoven** died in 1827, his **late string quartets** are being performed and published in Vienna, influencing generations of composers.
* **First Use of Portland Cement in UK Projects**: Early batches of **Portland cement**, created by **Joseph Aspdin**, begin being used in **infrastructure and bridge-building**, transforming construction durability.

### **October**

* **Founding of University College London (UCL)**: UCL formally opens its doors, offering a **non-religious alternative** to Oxford and Cambridge, and becoming a major center of **scientific and liberal education**.
* **First Use of Gas Lighting in American Streets**: Cities like Baltimore and Boston expand **gas-powered street lighting**, improving **public safety and night life** in urban centers.

### **November**

* **Electricity and Magnetism Studied by André-Marie Ampère**: Ampère continues pioneering work in **electrodynamics**, helping define what will later become **Ampère’s Law** in electromagnetism.
* **Experimental Rail Locomotives in Britain**: Designs for **faster, more stable rail engines** continue to emerge, setting the stage for **Stephenson’s Rocket** just a few years later (1829).

### **December**

* **Early Friction Matches Appear in England**: British chemists develop **early friction matches**, a significant improvement over flint and tinder, simplifying **fire-making** and household safety.
* **Navigation Advances on Major Rivers**: Steamboats on the **Mississippi and Ohio Rivers** increase in number and power, helping connect **agricultural centers** with **growing cities** like New Orleans and St. Louis.

1826 was a **transformative year**, marked by **scientific breakthroughs** like **Ohm’s Law** and the **first photograph**, as well as the expanding reach of **steam power, cement construction**, and **electromagnetism**. It blended **innovation, memory, and momentum** as the modern era gained speed.
